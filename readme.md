aim



The aim of this website is to showcase my work as a web developer and programmer. It will give the viewer a sense of my style for design and my technical ability.

The feel of this website should be simple, clean, lively and easy to navigate so the viewer can be attracted to the website and not lose interest as they go through the different pages
