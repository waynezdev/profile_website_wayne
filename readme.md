## **Purpose**



The aim of this website is to showcase my work as a web developer and programmer. It will give the viewer a sense of my style for design and my technical ability.

The feel of this website should be simple, clean, lively and easy to navigate so the viewer can be attracted to the website and not lose interest as they go through the different pages.



## **Functionality / features**

#### Feature 1

**Carousel** in the homepage to display of the most recent work.



#### Feature 2

**Blog page** to show my current activities and share certain personal life so viewers can get to know me better



#### Feature 3

**Contact form** for potential client or employer to easily contact me. Also for anyone want to send me any comments or feedback about my site.



## **Design**

##### **UX/UI**

In general I like simple things without too much useless bits. I want to convey that feeling in my website so the viewer can sense that straight away when they visit the website. It should look professional

navigation should be simple and easy to see where to click and what page you want to see. 



##### **Color theme**

![website24](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waynezdev/profile_website_wayne/master/docs/color_scheme/website24.jpg)

I chose this color theme to convey a professional and friendly feel to the viewer. I want potential clients to feel I'm approachable and speak their language instead of talking only in tech language and feel intimated. 

##### Font choices

top bar - Lato (bold) , fall back - Open Sans, sans-serif

Headings - Raleway, fallback -  Source Sans Pro, Arial

general text in paragraphs - Lato , fall back - Open Sans, Arial

Special words on images -  Nothing You Could Do, fall back - Rennie Beanie, Crimson Text, Arial



For one off special text I later chose to use image editing tools to get the exact size and position so I have better control over the presentation of images.

The screenshot below is an issue log which I used to keep track of small issues that I have to work on during the development of my site.

It gives me a better view of what I need to do to achieve things in the Trello board and track the completion of each issue
