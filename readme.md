## **Purpose**



The aim of this website is to showcase my work as a web developer and programmer. It will give the viewer a sense of my style for design and my technical ability.

The feel of this website should be simple, clean, lively and easy to navigate so the viewer can be attracted to the website and not lose interest as they go through the different pages.



##### **UX/UI**

In general I like simple things without too much useless bits. I want to convey that feeling in my website so the viewer can sense that straight away when they visit the website. It should look professional

navigation should be simple and easy to see where to click and what page you want to see.
